	<h2>Our company</h2>
	<p>Whishes was founded by R.C.Clage in 2015 on a simple principle : the waste of some is the
	treasure of others. We are based in the Paris region, France. We contract with companies to 
	dispose of their waste against remuneration, recycle them into toys or parts for medical devices 
	then we gave them to hospitals.</p>
	
	<h2>Our Goals</h2>
	<p>Our main goal is to reduce unecessary waste and transform them to help society.	We also try to
	developpe new ways to recycle waste to continue to reduce our waste.</p>
	
	<h2>Volonteers</h2>
	<p>We call on volunteers to do the distribution to be able to reach more hospital in the country.
	Their role is to organized and carry out the distribution of toys to hospitalized children. Thanks to
	them, we can arrange the distribution during week-end to allows the children's parents to be here to see 
	the joy of their children.</p>
